<h1 align="center">⭐Design Document⭐</h1>
The design of MitigasiEdu was guided by the goal of providing a user-friendly and informative platform for disaster mitigation education. The implementation relies on Python for the backend using the Flask framework, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

<br>

## Frontend
1. HTML and CSS were used to structure and style the website's layout and design.
2. JavaScript was employed to add interactivity to the website, such as dynamic content loading and form validation.

## Backend
1. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in developing web applications.
2. SQLite3 is used as the database system for storing earthquake data and user information.
3. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn were utilized for earthquake data analysis and machine learning-based earthquake predictions.
